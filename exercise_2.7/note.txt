How to remove Database directory (Without sudo):
Use Docker to Delete It: 
- You can run a container as root inside Docker to remove the folder:
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/mnt" alpine sh -c "rm -rf /mnt/database"

Use a Docker Container to Change Permissions:
- Just unlock it (instead of deleting):
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/mnt" alpine sh -c "chmod -R 777 /mnt/database"
- If you still want to delete after:
rm -rf ./database
