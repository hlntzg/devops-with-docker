# Docker and Containerization

This repository contains the exercises and examples I completed as part of the course Introduction to Containers with Docker and Docker Compose (DevOps with Docker 2025) from the University of Helsinki through [MOOC.fi](https://www.mooc.fi/en). The course provides an introduction to container technologies, with a particular focus on Docker and Docker Compose. It covers the fundamental concepts of Docker, including images and containers, and teaches how to build Docker images for existing projects and run them effectively. The course also explores Docker Compose, highlighting its role in managing complex multi-container applications and container orchestration. Practical exercises include deploying and managing real-world applications using Docker Compose.
