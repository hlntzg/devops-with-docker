# Docker and Containerization – Course Exercises

This repository contains the exercises and examples I completed as part of the course **"Introduction to Containers with Docker and Docker Compose."** (DevOps with Docker 2025) from University of Helsinki through MOOC.fi. The course provides an introduction to container technologies, with a particular focus on Docker and Docker Compose.

I'm using this repository to track my progress, experiment with Docker, and document what I’ve learned about containerization, orchestration with Docker Compose, and deploying web services.
