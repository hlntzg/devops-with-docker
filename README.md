# Docker and Containerization – Course Exercises

This repository contains the exercises and examples I completed as part of the course Introduction to Containers with Docker and Docker Compose (DevOps with Docker 2025) from the University of Helsinki through [MOOC.fi](https://www.mooc.fi/en). The course provides an introduction to container technologies, with a particular focus on Docker and Docker Compose.

### Course Modules
**Docker basics**
- Understand the fundamental concepts of Docker, including images and containers.
- Learn how to build Docker images for existing projects and run them.
- Understand how Docker can simplify the development process.

**Docker compose**
- Learn how to manage complex multi-container applications with Docker Compose.
- Understand the role of Docker Compose in container orchestration.
- Practice deploying and managing real-world applications using Docker Compose.

NOTE: I'm using this repository to track my progress, experiment with Docker, and document what I’ve learned about containerization, orchestration with Docker Compose, and deploying web services.
